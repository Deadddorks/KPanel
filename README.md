# KPanel
A Framework for beginners to easily work with graphics and input Event handling without having to do very much of the work themselves.
Simply set up a `KFrame` with a `KPanel`, set your `VERTICAL` & `HORIZONTAL` `GridConstraints`, and then you can add `Node`s to the
`Grid`, and their input events will be automatically handled, and the actions called by the `Node` can be easily set with a lambda expression.
